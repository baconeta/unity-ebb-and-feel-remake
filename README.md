# Ebb and Feel
#### _Ebb and Feel is a game of balance and stability. Find your inner peace or let the insanity consume you_

This was a remake of the Ludum Dare game as a Unity prep and practise project from [here](https://github.com/baconeta/ludum-dare-49).
I created this game entirely alone in approximately one week of light development time.

Ebb and Feel is a game produced for Ludum Dare #49 in 72 hours with a team of ten under the theme "Unstable".
